    "#### Water Jug Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"water jug\" problem can be stated as follows:  \n",
    "* you have a jug with a capacity of 7 liters of water, and a jug with a capacity of 3 liters of water, \n",
    "* you have a water source that will fill either jug to capacity\n",
    "* you have a drain that can be used to empty either jug  \n",
    "\n",
    "The available actions are\n",
    "* fill either jug from the water source\n",
    "* empty either jug into the drain\n",
    "* pour some water from a source jug into a destination jug.  The amount actually poured depends on the water level of the source jug and the capacity of the destination jug.   For example\n",
    "  * if you tried to pour the 3-capacity jug containing 2 liters into the 7-capacity jug containing 6 liters, the 3-capacity jug would contain 1 and the 7-capacity jug would contain 7\n",
    "  * if you tried to pour the 7-capacity jug containing 3 liters into the 3-capacity jug containing 0 liters, the 3-capacity jug would contain 3 liters and the 7-capacity jug would contain 0 liters\n",
    "  \n",
    "It costs 5 to fill either jug regardless of how much water is required.  It costs 3 to empty either jug regardless of how much water is emptied.  It costs 1 to transfer water from one jug to another, regardless of how much water is transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *problem* consists of \n",
    "* Initial -- the initial contents of both jugs\n",
    "* Goal -- a desired fill level for each jug\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, a problem is to find the lowest cost sequence of actions that starts with both jugs empty and results in 0 liters in the 3-liter jug and 3 liters in the 5-liter jug"
